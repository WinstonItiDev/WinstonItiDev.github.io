      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">        
        <p class="paragraph">I can really appreciate the self-driven approach to studying web development, but there is still a strong communal element at EDA. Everyone appears to be working on something in their own studies, and generally, that personally helps me want to study and work at it even more. The organic nature of EDA makes even more sense realizing that their are sister organizations similar to EDA the teach people in a similar way. Its like an organism, and I can really appreciate that. </p>
