    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
    <p>I can really appreciate the self-driven approach to studying web development, but there is still a strong communal element at EDA. Everyone appears to be working on something in their own studies, 
    and generally, that personally helps me want to study and work at it even more. The organic nature of EDA makes even more sense realizing that their are sister organizations similar to EDA the teach people in a similar way. Its like an organism on a global scale, and I can really appreciate that.</p>
    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
    <p>My impressions are positive. It almost feels like an organic entity, 
        with mechanisms going about on its own objectives. 
        Each person who is working towards a goal naturally increases the morale of the community.</p>
    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
    <p>On some level, I feel like I've been engaging in this type of culture already, albeit on a smaller capacity. Having studied music, there was still a self-driven component to the study of music. Students would help out other students, in terms of theory and sometimes technique.</p>
    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
    <p>Yes. I seem to expect less from EDA because I have to be self-driven to study.</p>
    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?</h3>
    <p>Most certainly. I've enjoyed the organic environment. People seem to walk in and out determined to be at a class, or complete some objective. It's exciting.</p>
    <h3>Does it make you nervous?</h3>
    <p>It does a little bit, especially at moments where I notice the gaps in my knowledge.</p>
