        </div>

      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">
        <p class="paragraph">When I hit a wall in programming or with challenges, I tend to notice my awareness starts to dip a bit. I notice my thoughts betray me, telling me "I'm an imposter". At that point, I try to observe my own thoughts and feelings. Turning ones disatisfaction with ones own abilities when comparing yourself to others and then turning it into humility, can be a great thing. It has helped me out in my previous studies in music performance. Being surrounded by other musicians or artists, is a lot like being around other coders. I've learnt in the past to stay humble about ones own abilities. Everyone started from the beginning, and understanding that atleast for me, can put things into perspective. 
        </p> 
        <p class="paragraph">During my time working on sprint-6, I found that the exercises I thought I could not solve, made me doubt my own abilities, which I guess could be described as negative thoughts. I've been allowing myself to observe my thoughts and feelings in those moments, letting the thoughts go, and then moving forward.</p> 
        <p class="paragraph">I want to develop my own inner self-regulation by observing my own thoughts, and pushing through a challenge.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I can appreciate it in several ways. It is easy to remember, and yes, it does conjure some imagery of a place surrounded by snow and a train with years of use. I think the sacred pause is a beautiful idea. I haven't always allowed my self to stop in the moment. I intend to use this as much as I can during times of distress.</p>
