      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">        
        <p class="paragraph">One particular problem I had when I first tried my hand at Vector Math, was making an object slow down as it reached its destination. That object was a 2d circle. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">        
        <p class="paragraph">I first tried writing it out on graph paper and doing the calculations on a calculator. Doing this made it easier to understand conceptually. I also tried asking questions on forums and such, which also helped me understand the concepts a bit better, and how to implement them.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">        
        <p class="paragraph">The process overall felt rewarding though difficult, because I spent several weeks trying to understand it but felt blocked due to my own implementation or lack of it. Eventually I came to realise my limits and barriers, and this experience helped me understand programming better than I had in the past, and had proliferated into my next round of study.</p>

      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">        
        <p class="paragraph">What I had learned was how to calculate vectors, which to me and still to this day, seems like a confusing ordeal, but I felt like I passed a barrier at that time and I hope to recreate it with some of the new skils I have learnt at EDA.</p>

      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">        
        <p class="paragraph">Psuedocode has been helpful in the past, but I really want to understand how to express psuedocode in a meaningful way without using jargon and non-specific terms.</p>

      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">        
        <p class="paragraph">Recently, I spent a few hours learning about circle packing, and following a tutorial on circle packing using processing, I tried to convert the Processing code to work in Javascript. I'd say I'm half way there completing the circle packing exercise and intend to finish after bootcamp.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">        
        <p class="paragraph">This seems like a reasonable concept, and I seem to do it without talking to a rubber ducky. If I dont understand a piece code, I try to go through it line by line so I at least understand an aspect of the code before going further. I hope to employ this concept in the future.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">        
        <p class="paragraph">Some of the code I had been studying and implementing in the previous two sprints often had spelling errors made by myself, so looking at the error messages helps me pinpoint where the code is going wrong. I would often think that there would be something wrong with the code structurally until I realized it was just a spelling error.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">        
        <p class="paragraph">I find console logging to be very useful. In areas where I need to know if something is working, plugging a variable and reading it from the console is tremendously helpful. I'd like to establish some type of standard in my own programming, where I wont log meaningless things but more direct terminology. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">        
        <p class="paragraph">I google code examples so I can quickly establish a segment of code for any particular objective. Some examples I look for happen to already exist in my study notes, but because of the amount of notes I have I find its easier to search for them online. I hope to work on my memory and retention when refering to such examples.</p>

      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">        
        <p class="paragraph">I think this may be an area I need to work on. It might not be a particular issue or a problem that I need to solve, but seeing what their standards are for programming and web development. Eventually, I think I'll stumble into a problem which will require to ask my peers.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">        
        <p class="paragraph">The answer is similar to the one above. I think earlier on I knew I needed help with utilizing a console and using waffle, and I asked for help in those areas. I try to keep it to a minimum unless the problem is way more than I can handle conceptually. </p>

      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">        
        <p class="paragraph">I realize that I still have to open up more to people, and not be afraid of asking questions. My process has grown but I still have more growing to do in all these areas.</p>
