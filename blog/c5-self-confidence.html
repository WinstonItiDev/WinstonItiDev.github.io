      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">        
        <p class="paragraph">The best way I could describe it is through the notion of attentiveness, within the body and the mind. Being able to focus on something without being judgemental of the thoughts themselves. <br><br> Being mindful is like self-awareness. Being self-aware requires an amount of attentiveness, and being self-aware means you are aware of the thoughts and feelings that your mind and body go through. <br><br>Mindfulness has an element of focus and attention that keeps your thoughts from building into (to use the metaphor in the book) a patch of dark clouds.</p>

      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">        
        <p class="paragraph">For the past couple of days, I gave a journaling a go, a practice I had been meaning to try in the past.<br><br>The first session lasted for five minutes, and based on the output that I gave, had made me realize how much is processing in my mind at any given time. <br><br>It made me feel non-judgemental, like I had discovered someone elses journal and discovered secrets of someone else I thought I knew.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="four columns middle-article-col-paragraph">        
        <p class="paragraph">This is something I have personally struggled with over the years, and what I did take away from this section of the book, is the sincerity and earnestness. Emotional Regulation has been a part of my self discovery and self-care. <br><br> Emotions can come at me like waves and reading this section has put things into perspective.</p>
