      <h3>List of Design Structures I'd like to use:</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Boxing</dt>
            <dd>- Compartmentalizing sections on a webpage similar to a table in Excel.</dd>
            <dt>Div</dt>
            <dd>- Div divides the webpage into different sections which is helpful during boxing, similar to an excel sheet having seperated labels on a table.</dd>
            <dt>Flexing boxes</dt>
            <dd>- The div that holds a set of divs (boxes) will shift in order with the css code display : flex;.</dd>
        </dl>
      <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
      <p>A holy trinity. Axis of evil? Each part represents a different function, Html deals with hands on information. CSS deals with aesthetic and style. DOM is a set standard of documentation.</p>
      <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
      <p>Boxifying design deals with seperating sections of a draft web design piece into different sections, similar to an excel spreadsheet, except you must define the boxes using the div function.</p>
      <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
      <p>Box Model refers to the layout. A box wraps around every HTML element to keep parts compartmentalized and polished looking. </p>
