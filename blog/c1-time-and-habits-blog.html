    <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
    <p>Currently, I've decided to try the Pomodore technique. I'll update this after I've tested the techinique. I have succesfully attempted a technique similar to Pomodoro. So I had set Toggl for 25 minutes and did some research on using CSS code. Timeboxing reminds me of the time I had to set time to practice my instrument during my music studies in Jazz Performance. Sight-reading in particular is something that has to be practiced slowly as well as regimented, to be as efficient as possible to increase your sight-reading abilities.</p>
    <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
    <p>Once you're focused on a particular task, and you're only giving yourself 25 minutes to complete the objective, a sense of satisfaction is felt due to the lack of pressure and time constraint.</p>
    <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
    <p>Pomodoro definitely has its benefits, and it is something I have experimented with in the past.</p>
    <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
    <p>I intend to experiment with this further, and I'll try adding my Pomodoro techniques to my schedule. Perhaps even increase the break periods if I feel like I have done more than enough.</p>
