        <p class="paragraph">Currently, I've decided to try the Pomodore technique. I'll update this after I've tested the techinique. I have succesfully attempted a technique similar to Pomodoro. So I had set Toggl for 25 minutes and did some research on using CSS code. Timeboxing reminds me of the time I had to set time to practice my instrument during my music studies in Jazz Performance. Sight-reading in particular is something that has to be practiced slowly as well as regimented, to be as efficient as possible to increase your sight-reading abilities.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I found a lot of it interesting. Once you're focused on a particular task, and you're only giving yourself 25 minutes to complete the objective, a sense of satisfaction is felt due to the lack of pressure and time constraint.</p>
